Breaking Changes
----------------
Generic Persistence Service
	- refactored - different class / interface names - configuration files may need changing
	- Oracle implementation - WORKFLOW_PKG is now called WORKFLOW_PERSISTENCE_PKG

Known Limitations
-----------------

This release does not support querying the tracking database. This will be provided
as a point release in the near future.

The tracking service provides no support for partitioning and is unlikely to be 
implemented (shouldn't partitioning be performed by the DBA at a database level, 
not by a developer in software!?).
